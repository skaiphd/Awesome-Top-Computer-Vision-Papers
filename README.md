|[One Transformer Fits All Distributions in Multi-Modal Diffusion at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06555) |[:octocat:](https://github.com/thu-ml/unidiffuser) | This paper proposes a unified diffusion framework (dubbed UniDiffuser) to fit all distributions relevant to a set of multi-modal data in one model. Inspired by the unified view, UniDiffuser learns all distributions simultaneously with a minimal modification to the original diffusion model - perturbs data in all modalities instead of a single modality, inputs individual timesteps in different modalities, and predicts the noise of all modalities instead of a single modality. |
